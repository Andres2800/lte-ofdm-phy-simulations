# lte-ofdm-phy-simulations
A collection of LTE-compliant OFDM transmission simulations implemented in Jupyter notebooks, including OFDM, SC-FDM, MIMO, SFBC, beamforming, multi-antenna reception, and channel coding. Each experiment transmits an image to visualize system performance and computes BER under realistic multipath and AWGN channels.
